    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Paneer Makhani is one of the most ordered dish in any Indian Restuarant.
      Paneer Makhani is a mildly spicy dish. The tomato gravy is creamy textured
      and somewhat sweet and tangy. The paneer pieces are shallow fried and
      added to the gravy. Paneer makhani gets its name ‘Makhani’ from its
      liberal use of butter, cream and cashewnut paste in it. Here is Paneer
      Makhani without onion garlic restuarant style.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tblsp of butter in a pan and add the cumin seeds. WHen the cumin
        seeds begin to crackle add the slit green chillies. Stir it for a minute
        and then add the strained tomato gravy base. Add all the dry masalas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cumin powder, red chilly powder, garam masala powder, sugar and
        salt. Remember that you have added salt already in the marinate. Also
        the amount of sugar that you add depends upon the sourness of the
        tomatoes. If the tomatoes are too sour adjust the sugar accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>Add crushed dry kasoori methi. Mix well.</li>
      <li>

        are covered with the gravy.

        Lower the flame and add fresh cream at this stage. Mix it quickly as we
        will not be cooking for too long now. Otherwise the cream may curddle.
